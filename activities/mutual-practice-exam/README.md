# Mutual practice exam

The students prepare quiz questions \(see [Creating quiz questions](activities/creating-quiz-questions/README.md)\). Then, small groups mutually test each other on these questions.

## Learning outcomes

* Revise and better understand the content covered in class.

## Setup and preparation

* The students prepare quiz questions as in the activity [Creating quiz questions](activities/creating-quiz-questions/README.md).
* The students bring these questions to class (online or printed)

## Activity overview

1. The students create small groups so that the total number of groups is even. The groups can be the same as in which the questions were created.
2. Pair the groups together. For example, if you have groups A, B, C, D, each with two students, create pairs A-B, C-D.
3. The groups alternate in asking the quiz questions to each other.
  * Each group asks its 5 created questions to the other group one by one.
  * Only one person from the group can answer to avoid one fast member answering all the questions.
  * If the asked person cannot answer, encourage discussion and hints.
4. Have the groups record each question that was troublesome or incorrectly answered.
* Která otázka byla sporná a diskutovali jste ji v rámci skupiny? K jakému řešení jste přišli?
5. After both groups within a pair finish all their questions, have them revise the troublesome questions to make sure they understand correctly now.

## Tips and tricks

* This is a good practice activity before a midterm or a final exam.
* You can have the students select from all the questions of the whole class, not only the ones they themselves created.
* You can incorporate competitive elements, for example:
  * Giving 1 points for a correct answer and 0 \(easier\) or -1 \(strict\) point for an incorrect answer. Award the top scoring teams.
  * Have more groups compete against each other \(such as A and B together against C and D\).
* You can play a "Question elimination game":
  * The students stand in a circle.
  * The teacher selects one student and randomly generates a number of the question that student will receive.
  * If the student answers incorrectly, (s)he sits down.
  * The last N standing receive an award (such as points for the course).
  * Teams can play against each other, while each team has a certain amount of "lives".
